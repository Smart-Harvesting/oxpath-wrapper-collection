# StarTrekIndex Wrapper

The wrapper for the German website https://www.startrek-index.de is used to extract data on episodes of the television series "Star Trek".
The site makes heavy use of tables and the wrapper uses this structure to find the links to individual episodes in the respective column of the table.
The detail pages of episodes contain the episode title (both German and English), a detailed description of the plot, and also a detailed rating of the episode, which are all extracted.
