# Nature example

**Goal:** extract from Nature embargo e-mails information about the embargoed publications:
*   title
*   embargo (i.e. date information)

**Peculiarities:** The thing that's special about this use case is that we are not extracting from a page on the web, but from a HTML file. But as such a file can also be opened in a browser and is rendered there, it makes no difference for OXPath.
