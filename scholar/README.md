# Google Scholar Wrappers

### scholar.oxp

This wrapper demonstrates how to extract data from the results of a Google Scholar search.
The search term is entered in the query box and submitted by clicking the button next to the box.
Then, the filter for publication year is activated by clicking on the respective link.
With a Kleene star expression, looping over the result pages is performed by continually clicking on the "next page" button.
The title of each result is extracted.

<!--**Goal:** type a query in the search box, and for each result, extract:
*   title
*   authors
*   cited_by
    *   title
    *   authors

**Note:** we plan to use a variant of this expression for getting citation numbers off Google scholar for specific publications.
