# Frontiers wrappers

Several wrappers to extract data from Frontiers publications.

## frontiers-counter.oxt

## frontiers-val.oxt

Extracts a title. Target url is a variable.

## frontiers-scroller.oxt

This script contains several variables. One is for the target url. Another set of variables is used to limit the date range for search results. 

This script demonstrates how the "scroll to load more" action can be scripted with mouseover. A variable is used to limit the number of times the page is scrolled.

## frontiers-counter.oxt

Similar to frontiers-scroller.oxt, but instead of scrolling the page, it simply outputs the number of results.

## frontiers-extractor.oxt

This wrapper is used to extract record metadata from a url.
