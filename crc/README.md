# CRC Wrappers

These wrappers were originally for http://www.crcnetbase.com/.
They do not work anymore since this URL now redirects to https://www.taylorfrancis.com/ which has a complete different layout and structure.

## crc-book-search-by-year.oxp

Originally used to search for books by year and extract metadata from results.

## crc-book-search-by-year.oxt

Same as crc-book-search-by-year.oxp, but with variable for the year.

## crc-book-toc.oxp

Scrape metadata from the table of contents of a specific book.

## crc-book-toc.oxt

Same as crc-book-toc.oxp, but with variable for the url. Can be used in conjunction with crc-book-search-by-year which extracts the toc URLs of books.
